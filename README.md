# Airbnb-user-statistics
This program takes the URL of a particular airbnb user from melbourne, and displays the total number of reviews of the user along with his ranking based on reviews.

In order to run the file, download anaconda navigator, then launch JupyterLab.
Download the file into your desktop or upload it directly from the Github repo into JupyterLab.
After loading the file into JupyterLab just restart the Kernel in and the enter the URL of any user from AirBnb (eg: https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/99824610) you want to find the statistics of.
The program then checks whether the user is a valid user or not and then displays its total reviews as well as his reputation (i.e his percentage ranking among the top users in a geographical region, eg: Melbourne).

Note the % ranking of a user might change over a period of time, as AirBnb's database keeps on being updated, so any user below the given user might get get ahead of him or any user above the given user might go below him.
